Feature: Get hottest and coldest date from last one week for 5 cities

  Given I have access to the historical weather data of weather api
  And I have a list of 5 cities
  And I want to know the hottest and coldest day of the last week
  When I call the historical data weather api
  Then I can get the hottest and the coldest day of the week for the cities I have listed

	Background: 
	 # Calling a java class GetDates.java that returns today's date as StartDate and 7th day as ToDate or end date
	  * def GetDates = Java.type('com.KarateGatlingDemo.GetDates')	
	 
	 # Calling initialSetup method that encapsulates the logic on how the the dates are computed
	 	* def setup = GetDates.initialSetup()
	
	 # Storing the dates to the variables that will be used as path parameters in the endpoint URL	
		* def ToDate = GetDates.getTodaysDate()
		* def StartDate = GetDates.get7DaysAgoDate()
	
	
	

   Scenario: Get the hottest day and coldest day of the week
   # weather_7day_api is declared in karate-config.js. This is where all the end points are listed.
   # All variables in karate-config.js act like 'global variables' in Karate
   # apiKey comes from the maven command line. This key is got from weather API to use their APIs.
   # The reason I have added this on the command line is that this can go as a configuration on the CI/CD configs
   
    Given url weather_7day_api
    And param key = apiKey
   # names get picked up from the Examples table defined at the bottom of this feature file
    And param q = 'los angeles' 
    And param dt = StartDate
    And param end_dt = ToDate
    When method get
   # Asserting the end point gives a 200 OK status
    Then status 200 
    And def result = response 
   # Checking if the results of the endpoint gives us exactly 7 days of data 
    And assert response.forecast.forecastday.length == 7 
   # More assertions can be very easily defined here. We can have various matches too, matching the values in the response with the expected values  
  
   # javascript function that returns the index of the array that has the highest temperature in the last 7 days
   # There are various different ways of doing this but wrote a js function just to demo that Karate very easily
   # supports calling java classes and even javascript functions.
   # These functions can be placed in the Background section of this feature file too.
